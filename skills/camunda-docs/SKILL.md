  Use this skill to look up Camunda 8 documentation. The official docs at docs.camunda.io are the source of truth for current behavior — FEEL function signatures, BPMN extension attribute shapes, REST API endpoints, version requirements, feature availability. Trigger any time you need to verify a Camunda specific against the current docs, including when you think you already know the answer — Camunda 8 evolves fast and training data drifts. If you start with a conceptual explanation and find yourself about to state specifics (defaults, names, syntax, version requirements), stop and invoke before writing those specifics.

# Camunda Docs Lookup

Two retrieval paths into `docs.camunda.io`, each with a different strength. Pick by question shape; fall back to `llms.txt` only if both are unavailable.

| Path | Mechanism | Best for | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **camunda-docs MCP** | Semantic retrieval (vector search) over docs + other Camunda knowledge sources | Conceptual or fuzzy questions; you don't know the exact term; want chunks ready to read | Top-k markdown chunks with source URLs |
| **Algolia DocSearch** | Classical lexical search (the same index docs.camunda.io's own search box uses) | You know the term; want **version-scoped** results (8.7 vs 8.9 vs next); want to triage a ranked page list | Ranked pages with title, hierarchy, snippet — fetch the page for full content |
| **llms.txt / llms-full.txt** | Static text index/corpus | Offline fallback when neither service is reachable | Plain text; grep locally |

Use both primary paths in parallel when in doubt — they're cheap and frequently surface different relevant pages.

## camunda-docs MCP server

If the `camunda-docs` MCP server (`https://camunda-docs.mcp.kapa.ai`, HTTP transport) is connected, call its knowledge search tool with a single, well-formed natural-language sentence (the tool requires a complete sentence, not keywords).

If it isn't connected, suggest installing it once so the user has it set up for future questions. Skip the suggestion if you've already made it earlier in this conversation. For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http camunda-docs https://camunda-docs.mcp.kapa.ai
```

For VS Code Copilot, Cursor, or generic MCP clients, see [the reference](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/reference/mcp-docs/). Google sign-in on first use; 40 requests/hour and 200/day per user; not for CI.

## Algolia DocSearch

A bash wrapper around the public Algolia DocSearch endpoint lives at `scripts/docs-search.sh`. Run it as:

```bash
scripts/docs-search.sh "<query>" [--version stable|next|<major>.<minor>|all] [--limit N]
```

Default `--version stable` resolves to the highest numeric version in the index (so it keeps working when 9.0 ships). Default `--limit 10`. Returns JSON:

```json
{
  "query": "...",
  "version": "stable",
  "algolia_version": "8.9",
  "total": 5,
  "total_matching": 25,
  "hits": [
    { "url": "...", "hierarchy": "...", "title": "...", "snippet": "..." }
  ]
}
```

- `total` — hits in this response.
- `total_matching` — raw count of pages matching the query in the index, before pagination/dedupe. Useful for "how broadly does my term appear?"
- `algolia_version` — the `version` facet value sent to the index (e.g. `"8.9"`, `"current"`). `null` in `--version all` mode (no facet filter applied).

### Search flow

1. **Pick a version** (see table below). Default `stable`.
2. Run the script.
3. Inspect the hits — each has `url`, `hierarchy`, `title`, `snippet`.
4. **Open the most relevant page(s) with WebFetch** to read full context. Snippets are short; don't answer from them alone if the question needs detail.
5. **Refine if insufficient** — see refinement strategy below.

### Version handling

The Camunda docs are versioned in the URL path. The Algolia `version` facet exposes those versions — without filtering, the same page returns 3-4 times across versions, which is noisy.

| Flag value | Algolia facet | URL prefix | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stable` (default) | highest numeric (e.g. `8.9`) | `/docs/` | General questions, no version context |
| `next` | `current` | `/docs/next/` | Upcoming/unreleased behavior, alpha features |
| `8.8` / `8.7` / etc. | matching numeric | `/docs/8.8/` etc. | Customer/cluster on a specific generation |
| `all` | (none) | any | Comparing versions; results deduped by URL stem so best-relevance version per page wins |

**Pick explicitly when:**

- Question is about a specific customer/cluster on a known generation → use that version.
- Question is about an upcoming feature, an alpha, or "will this change in 8.10?" → run `stable` and `next` in parallel and compare.
- Question is version-neutral (concepts, BPMN semantics, generic API shape) → `stable` is fine.

In `--version all` mode the script over-fetches (4× `--limit`, capped at 100) so that after dedupe by URL stem the response contains close to `--limit` unique pages. Dedupe preserves Algolia's relevance order — first hit per unique URL stem wins, then trimmed to `--limit`.

### Examples

```bash
# Default — latest stable
scripts/docs-search.sh "zeebe gateway long polling timeout"

# Specific version (customer on 8.7)
scripts/docs-search.sh "task assignment" --version 8.7

# Upcoming behavior
scripts/docs-search.sh "agentic connectors" --version next

# Compare across versions (deduped by URL stem)
scripts/docs-search.sh "decision evaluation API" --version all --limit 15
```

### Refinement strategy

If the first query is unhelpful:

- **Too broad → too many off-topic hits**: add specifics (component, error code, config key).
- **Too narrow → no hits**: drop adjectives, try the canonical product term (e.g. `"Tasklist"` not `"task UI"`, `"Zeebe"` not `"workflow engine"`).
- **Wrong version**: try `--version all` to see if the term exists elsewhere, then narrow to the right release.
- **Synonyms**: try alternative names — e.g. `"Operate"` ↔ `"process monitoring"`, `"Optimize"` ↔ `"analytics"`.

Don't loop more than 2-3 refinements. If still nothing, switch to the MCP path (or note the gap to the user).

### No credentials needed

The Algolia search-only API key is public — Algolia ships it in the browser JS bundle of docs.camunda.io, so every visitor already has it. It's hardcoded at the top of `scripts/docs-search.sh` with a comment explaining why it's safe to commit. No env vars, no auth, safe in CI.

### If curl/jq aren't available

The script needs `curl` and `jq`. If either is missing in your environment (e.g. Windows without WSL, sandbox without `jq`), replicate the request directly:

```bash
curl -sf -X POST \
  "https://6KYF3VMCXZ-dsn.algolia.net/1/indexes/camunda-v2/query" \
  -H "X-Algolia-API-Key: 68db7725a8410eace68419c29385ad1e" \
  -H "X-Algolia-Application-Id: 6KYF3VMCXZ" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"YOUR QUERY","hitsPerPage":10,"facetFilters":[["version:8.9"]]}'
```

Substitute the `version:` facet for the version you want (`current` for `next`, omit `facetFilters` entirely for `all`). The response shape is Algolia's raw hits — useful fields per hit are `url`, `hierarchy.lvl0..lvl5`, and `content`. If `curl` is also unavailable, use any HTTP client that can POST JSON (Python `urllib`, Node `fetch`, PowerShell `Invoke-RestMethod`); the endpoint, headers, and body are the same. The credentials in the snippet are public by design (see "No credentials needed" above).

## Fallback: llms.txt (docs index)

If neither MCP nor Algolia is usable, fetch [`https://docs.camunda.io/llms.txt`](https://docs.camunda.io/llms.txt) (~540 KB) — an index of `- [Title](url): description.` lines for every Camunda 8 docs page. **Do not read the whole file into context.** Cache it locally, search for the term to find the matching URL, then fetch that page directly.

## Last resort: llms-full.txt (full docs corpus)

Only if `llms.txt` doesn't surface what you need, fall back to [`https://docs.camunda.io/llms-full.txt`](https://docs.camunda.io/llms-full.txt) (~11 MB) — every docs page concatenated. **Even larger; never read whole into context.** Cache locally, search with surrounding context for the term. Use when the right page name isn't obvious from the index.
